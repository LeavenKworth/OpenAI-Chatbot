## üß† AI Agent (Python)

The AI agent is implemented in Python using  OpenAI's API. It parses incoming chat messages, extracts intent and parameters using LangChain-like tools, and routes requests to the appropriate backend services (Midterm APIs).

- Uses OpenAI
- Parses chat intent and parameters
- Handles business logic interaction

---

## üîÑ API Gateway (C# .NET + Ocelot)

All frontend requests go through the .NET-based API Gateway, following the Ocelot pattern:

- Central entry point for all API traffic
- Routes chat messages to Python AI agent or midterm APIs
- Basic auth/token passing for simplicity
- 
---

## üíª Frontend (React)

A responsive chat UI built with React.js:

- Sends all user messages through the API Gateway
- Displays AI-generated replies and intermediate outputs

## ‚ùå Firebase?

Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore **was not used**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

![sequence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a560b4f-0736-4b0d-838a-34ffdbab289f)


1. User sends a message via the React chat UI.
2. Message is sent to the API Gateway (C# .NET).
3. Gateway forwards the message to the AI Agent (Python).
4. AI Agent:
   - Parses the intent via LLM (OpenAI/Ollama/Mistral)
   - Calls appropriate Midterm API(s)
   - Forms a response
5. Response is routed back to the frontend via the Gateway.
6. UI is updated with the latest message.

## Challenges I Faced
1. Integrating Python AI Agent with C# .NET Gateway:
It was challenging to properly route HTTP requests from the .NET gateway to the Python AI Agent.
2.Following the API Gateway pattern using .NET:
Most online examples for API Gateway were in Node.js, so adapting the Acelot-style architecture into .NET required additional research. I struggled with implementing clean routing logic and managing endpoints across services.
3. LLM API Integration (OpenAI):
Connecting to the OpenAI API and parsing the model‚Äôs response into actionable intents was not straightforward. I had to experiment with different prompt designs and output formats to make it usable in my application logic.
4. Cross-Origin and Dev Environment Setup:
Setting up three separate services (React, .NET, Python) and making them communicate on local development servers with proper ports and CORS headers was one of the trickiest parts of the project.

5.No Firebase / Real-time Handling
